# AES File Handling

This is some code ripped from my coursework last year which handles encrypted files stored on disk.

The encryption standard used is AES256-CBC. **This is for demonstration purposes only, not to be used for real applications.**

Working with files is exactly the same as handling regular files in Python, except additional arguments must be passed for the encryption parameters.
